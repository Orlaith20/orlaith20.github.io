    <h2> What Is Binary? </h2>
    <p>
        Binary is a base-2 numeral system, meaning it has only two digits: 0 and 1. 
        
      This is in contrast to our familiar decimal system, which is base-10 and has 
        ten digits (0 through 9). Binary is the cornerstone of all digital computing, 
        as it's the most straightforward way to represent the on/off states of 
        electronic switches within a computer's circuitry.

    <h2> Why Do We Use Binary? </h2>
     <p>
        Computers use binary because electronic components can easily distinguish 
        between two voltage levels, representing 0 and 1.
       
       By organizing data in this 
        binary format, computers can perform complex calculations, store information, 
        and communicate with other digital devices. To work effectively with computers 
        and understand the processes that occur inside them, you must be familiar with 
        binary.

    <h2> Basic Binary Conversions</h2>
    <p>
         <b> 1. Decimal to Binary:</b>
      </p>
     <ol class="steps">
          <li class="li3">Divide the decimal number by 2. </li>
          <li class="li3"> Record the remainder. </li>
          <li class="li3"> Continue dividing the quotient by 2 until it reaches 0, recording the remainders each time. </li>
          <li class="li3"> The binary representation is the sequence of remainders in reverse order. </li>
      </ol>
    
         <p><b>Example:</b>
         Convert 10 (decimal) to binary:
         10 รท 2 = 5, remainder 0
         5 รท 2 = 2, remainder 1
         2 รท 2 = 1, remainder 0
         1 รท 2 = 0, remainder 1

        So, 10 (decimal) is 1010 in binary.
         </p>
      <p>
       <b> 2. Binary to Decimal:</b> 
      </p>
     <ol class="steps">
        <li class="li3"> Read the binary number from right to left. </li>
        <li class="li3"> Write down the binary number. </li>
        <li class="li3"> Assign a place value to each digit, starting from 1 for the rightmost digit and doubling it as you move left. </li>
        <li class="li3">Multiply each digit by its corresponding place value.</li>
        <li class="li3"> Sum up all the results to get the decimal equivalent. </li>
     </ol>
  
      <p>
         <b>Example:</b>
         Convert 1010 (binary) to decimal:
          0 * 1 + 1 * 2 + 0 * 4 + 1 * 8 = 0 + 2 + 0 + 8 = 10 (decimal)</p>
